The shiny app generated by ShinyCell can be easily deployed in a variety of 
ways, namely via (i) https://www.shinyapps.io/, (ii) in-house server using R 
Shiny Server or (iii) other cloud computing platforms e.g. Amazon Web Services 
(AWS). The ease and availability of several cloud options is due to the use of 
R Shiny backend, which is designed to be easily deployed online.


## shinyapps.io
One of the simplest way to deploy the shiny app is via the dedicated online 
service https://www.shinyapps.io/. First, one has to register for an account, 
which will prompt the user to create an account name `ACCOUNT` that will 
constitute part of the URL of the eventual shiny app. After registration, one 
has to setup the connection between your R / RStudio and shinyapps.io via the 
code below. One can then then upload the shiny app by specifying the shiny app 
directory `shinyApp` and the app will be available online at 
`https://[ACCOUNT].shinyapps.io/shinyApp/`. For more details, refer to the 
[shinyapps user guide](https://docs.rstudio.com/shinyapps.io/).

``` r
install.packages('rsconnect')     # package to interface shiny apps
library(rsconnect)

rsconnect::setAccountInfo(name="<ACCOUNT>", 
                          token="<TOKEN>",
                          secret="<SECRET>") 
rsconnect::deployApp("shinyApp/")
```


## R Shiny Server
If you have a on-site server, you can deploy the shiny app on the server via 
[R Shiny Server](https://rstudio.com/products/shiny/shiny-server/). This 
requires the installation of R Shiny Server for your corresponding operating 
system, details of which can be found [here](
https://rstudio.com/products/shiny/download-server/).

After installing R Shiny Server, the shiny app can be deployed by placing the 
entire folder `shinyApp` into the directory `/srv/shiny-server/`. The shiny 
app can then accessed online via `[IP-address-of-server]:3838/shinyApp`. For 
more details, refer to the [Administratorâ€™s Guide](
https://docs.rstudio.com/shiny-server/).


## Amazon Web Services (AWS)
It is possible to deploy the shiny app cloud computing platforms. Here, we 
will briefly outline how to do so on Amazon Web Services (AWS). There are 
three steps, namely (i) creating a new Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance, 
(ii) installing R and R Shiny Server and (iii) deploying the shiny app.

There are several online tutorials on how to deploy shiny apps on AWS such as

and https://www.charlesbordet.com/en/guide-shiny-aws.
